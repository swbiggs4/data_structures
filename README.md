# data_structures
Basic python implementations of common data structures and algorithms

* Search: Binary Search on sorted data. Guesses to over/ under estimate. O(logN)
* Sort: In conjunction with Search. Explicit, ith biggest. Merge Sort Quick Sort,  Merge sort better w/ big arrays, quick sort w/ smaller arrays. O(NLogN) typical.
* Recursion: Combinations, Choices, Superlatives. O(2^N) choices time, O(N) space.
* Hash Tables: Dictionaries. Counting. Strings, numbers, tuples hashable O(const)
* Stacks: Undos. LIFO. O(N)
* Queues: Process as they come. FIFO. O(N)
* Trees: Specified, or with Hierarchical data. O(logN) balanced, O(N) unbalanced. 
* Heaps: Priority Queues
* Graphs: Relationships, connections, analogies, transitive properties, matrices.
